# Custom Validation in Spring Boot 3

This project demonstrates how to implement custom validation in a Spring Boot application.

## Overview

Custom validation allows you to define your own validation rules beyond the standard ones provided by Spring. This can be useful for enforcing specific business logic constraints.

In this project, we showcase how to create custom validation annotations, validators, and how to apply them to Spring Rest endpoints.

## Features

- Custom validation annotations
- Custom validator classes
- Integration with Spring Rest controllers
- Error handling and response customization

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhileshtrivedi/springboot-validation-rest-api-main.git
``` 
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
   cd springboot-validation-rest-api-main
```     
3. Build the project using Maven:

```sh
   mvn clean install
```   
4. Run the application:

```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
```



## Usage
Make sure the application is running locally.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

You can use the Swagger UI to test the custom validation endpoints.
